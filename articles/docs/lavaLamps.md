## What is Cloudflare?
 Cloudflare is an American company that ensures and improves the security and performance of websites, applications and network. <br>
 Cloudflare takes the internet traffic that’s meant for your website or app and routes it through its many data centers all over the world. They are then forwaded to your server.
 
 *It's like rather than taking the direct, less travelled by and unsafe road, the audience coming to watch your performance take a safer route.*

 * It filters out malicious accesses and traffic <br>*like a traffic controller*
 * It provides SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) certificates --> identification of which: 
    1. the padlock on the address bar
    2. The URLs beginning with  **https:** instead of **http:**
* Make websites load faster
* and more!

Now about 20% of ALL internet traffic today goes through their servers.
### Why would one the biggest Internet Security companies rely on lava lamps for security keys...?
Are they crazy?<br>
Nah. This brings us to our second section- **Need for randomness in Cyptography**

## Need for randomness in Cyptography
For a secure encryption of 
- HTTPS connections
- TLS handshakes 
- cookies
- passswords 
- VPN connections
- etc.

Randomness is needed to generate secure, unpredictable keys that protect all encrypted communication on the internet. a<br>
*Like a passcode to your mobile phone<br> the more random it is, the harder it is for a someone to guess and unlock your phone* 
<br><br>on the internet it makes sure attackers can't
- decrypt the data
- spy on the traffic
- hijack a session
- impersonate
<br> Since computers are dumb (*writer shrugs*) and follow a pre-prepared set of instructions to give a pre-determined result, they are incapable of giving real, random sequences to encrypt data on such large scale.<br>
Hence they lack "chaos"
<br>Which is when we turn to **nature** and **real-world**.
